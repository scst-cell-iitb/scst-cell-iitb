									<h1>Dismantling the myth of Merit</h1>
								</header>

								<strong> 1. What is ‘merit’ and ‘meritocracy’?</strong>
								<p>
									‘Merit’ is the virtue of being able to out-perform others or fulfil a
									set criterion of performance among a group of individuals.
								</p>
								<p>
									A ‘meritocracy’ is an ideal world where preference and rewards are
									directly proportional to the performance, hence better performers gain
									higher rewards. But a pre-condition to such world is that there is no
									discrimination and bias against anyone, that all are provided a level
									playing field where everyone is at the same starting point in terms of
									socio-economic, political and cultural privilege.
								</p>
								<p>
									It is a wonderful idea. But if a society thinks that it is a
									meritocracy with its pre-conditions present, when in reality it isn't,
									this idea becomes something very dark and twisted. It is because it
									contains a fundamental belief that the successful deserve their
									success and those who fail, deserve their failure.
								</p>

								<p><strong>2. Background of meritocracy in India -</strong></p>

								<p>
									On August 16 1932, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar was able to secure the Communal
									Award which provided separate electorates for Dalits. This ensured
									that only Dalits were eligible to vote in the seats allocated to them.
									This would have ensured that there was no interference of non-Dalits
									in the governance and administration of Dalits. In this way, they
									could carve their progress outside the Hindu caste system which
									suppressed them for centuries. This was perceived by MK Gandhi as a
									threat to Hindu Unity. Also, it would have left the Congress as
									representing at best only the non-Dalit Hindus, comprising roughly 50%
									of the country’s population. M.K. Gandhi went on a fast unto death if
									Dalits continued their demands to split. This was a huge gesture, and
									it effectively forced Ambedkar to concede. The compromise that emerged
									was called the Poona Pact, wherein instead of separate electorates,
									the Scheduled Castes were going to get "reservations." So essentially,
									in order that Dalits can be merged into the larger Hindu voter base,
									they had to compromise on their self-secured emancipation given as
									Communal Award. And worse thing is that from the moment reservations
									were implemented, upper castes have constantly complained that it has
									been destroying merit and they are making it as an excuse to harass
									Dalits and Adivasis in public institutions. Whereas, in the first
									place India was never a meritocracy nor has attained that state yet.
									So firstly, Dalits & Adivasis were made to compromise on their rights
									and now they are humiliated for the limited provisions they have been
									offered. Hence, reservations which are called out as
									concessions/charity/compromise made by upper caste are in fact the
									compromise imposed upon Dalits by the upper caste in exchange of a
									highly empowering system of Communal Award.

									<strong>
										3. Meritocracy demands a level playing field. So, is India a
										fertile land for meritocracy as of now?
									</strong>
								</p>
								<p>No, it is not. Some facts can help us answer this.</p>

								<ol type="a">
									<li>
										<strong> Crime Data: </strong><br />
										According to NCRB data, there were 33,719 cases of crimes against
										Dalits in 2011, and this figure rose to 50,291 in 2020. A more
										horrific picture appears when one looks at the crimes against Dalit
										women. Almost 10 Dalit women or girls are raped each day. A total of
										8,272 cases were registered for committing crime against Scheduled
										Tribes (STs), showing an increase of 9.3 per cent over 2019 (7,570
										cases)
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong> Representation Data: </strong>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<strong> Judiciary </strong>- According to National Commission
												for Schedules Castes, in 2011 out of 850 High Court judges, only
												24 come from Dalit and Adivasi communities
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong> Education </strong>- In 2018, representation of SC, ST,
												OBC faculty in total at IITs was merely 9% and at IIMs it was
												even grim at a mere 6%
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong>Civil Services </strong> - In 2019, government in
												Parliament reported that only one of the 89 secretaries posted
												at the Centre belonged to the Scheduled Castes (SC), while three
												belong to the Scheduled Tribes and none belonged to OBC. Out of
												93 additional secretaries in central government ministries, just
												six are SCs and five are STs, while there are no OBCs of this
												rank either.
											</li>
											<li>
												<strong> Economic status </strong> - According to a 2014
												government report, over 44.8 percent of Scheduled Tribe (ST) and
												33.8 percent of Scheduled Caste (SC) groups in rural India
												continue to live below the poverty line.
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>
											Some shocking incidents of caste discrimination against Dalits in
											higher positions :
										</strong>
										<ul>
											<li>
												Earlier this year in February, a Dalit IPS officer who wanted to
												ride horse had to take heavy police protection for his
												pre-wedding ceremony in Jaipur.
											</li>
											<li>
												In 2020, Priya who is a Dalit and a panchayat president in
												Mayiladuthurai of Nagapattinam district alleged that the
												panchayat vice-president had been threatening her and not
												allowing her to use the chair allotted to her at the office.
											</li>
											<li>
												In 2019, Payal Tadvi who was an Adivasi and a medical PG student
												in Nair Hospital, Mumbai committed suicide due to caste
												harassment from her upper caste colleagues.
											</li>
										</ul>

									<strong>
										4. So, why is it that merit outcry is made by upper caste when
										essentially there is no ground for meritocracy in the unequal
										societal structure of India?
									</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									The ground for merit outcry for upper castes comes from
									non-recognition of their own privileges. Our constitution only
									recognizes caste as a source of disadvantages for lower caste. Upper
									castes have spent centuries accumulating enormous caste capital. This
									capital looks different for different communities. For Brahmins, it's
									a history of access to literacy learning and as a result
									administrative power. For Vaishyas and Kshatriyas, it could mean
									control over land and wealth and trading networks. These pre-existing
									advantages mean that when the British established a westernized
									education system, upper castes were the first to benefit. When this
									education system became the basis of entry for all the new professions
									like law and the Indian civil service, again they were the first to
									benefit. And that advantage keeps getting passed down from generation
									to generation. In this way, over time, caste capital is converted into
									modern "currency" - into qualifications, into professional
									achievements. And because the Constitution does not officially
									recognize any of these caste advantages, upper castes could capture
									all of independent India's opportunities while insisting they had done
									it through fair and open competition. At the same time in government
									jobs and in education, upper castes labeled themselves as "General" -
									while lower caste had to identify their specific caste.
								</p>
								<p>
									This is a situation that is fundamentally weird. It actively hides the
									truth. This became clear in 1990 when the government announced that
									it's going to implement the recommendations of the Mandal Commission
									and new quotas were created in public sector jobs and in education for
									OBCs who were historically deemed as "Shudras" and occupied the lowest
									rung in the caste order and therefore faced oppression and
									exploitation as well. Half of all the seats were now reserved.
									Immediately there were huge protests across India, led mostly by upper
									castes, who complained that this would destroy merit in India forever.
									The only reason that every oppressed group, i.e. SC, ST and OBC needed
									caste need reservations is because the "General" category was being
									over-represented by upper castes (see pt. 7, 1st para). According to
									the Mandal Commission, India's population was roughly 23% SC-ST and
									52% OBC. So, put together they're roughly 75% of the whole country.
									And the recommended reservation for both together was roughly 50%.
									This meant that the remaining 50% of all jobs and university seats
									continued to be dominated by upper castes, who were roughly only 25%
									of the whole country. This is the upper caste reservation which is
									seldom talked about. Now, the protests around the Mandal Commission
									suddenly appear in a very different light. They're not about upper
									caste fighting for the principles of fairness and merit. They are
									about upper class fighting against the reduction in their quota of
									seats.
								</p>

								<p>
									<strong>5. Myth of castelessness and the myth of merit : </strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									Younger generations in upper caste families may genuinely believe that
									they are "casteless". But all that means is that their parents did the
									conversion of caste capital into money and qualifications before them.
									In their lifetime, they might not be seeing any benefits from caste
									specifically. But for this generation at least, all those benefits
									that come from family are caste, it's just one step removed. These
									generations may have to remind themselves that there is no Maths or
									engineering gene. There is nothing intrinsic about Brahmins that makes
									them better at intellectual pursuits. Being born a Rajput does not
									automatically make someone brave, Baniyas are not inherently good at
									business. If there is a distinguishable pattern of upper caste
									dominance in the general category of an institution like IIT, that is
									not a sign of merit. That is a sign that the caste system is still
									alive, that caste capital is still deciding the lives of people today.
								</p>

								<p>
									<strong>
										6. Brahminical merit vs Scientific constitutional merit
									</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									Reservations as an instrument of government policy emerged as an
									integral part of the anti-Brahmanical movements in Maharashtra and
									Tamil Nadu in the dawn of the 20th century. The attack on reservations
									under the garb of merit outcry emanate from a Brahminical idea of
									merit rather than from any scientific or constitutional concept of
									merit.
								</p>
								<p>
									Brahminical idea of merit is that the merit possessed by an individual
									is essentially acquired in unverifiable previous births. So
									essentially the unequal nature of society around is justified by the
									Brahmanical notion of karma and rebirth which implies that a lower
									caste is born in a pitiable state due to his/her own bad karma. Hence,
									those who claim of merit violation by reservations essentially believe
									that their own privileges are justified as they were earned by them in
									their previous births leading their births in upper caste community.
									This is a very cunning plot which defies all scientific logic. A
									scientific and constitutional concept of merit doesn’t allow any
									illogical, superstitious or religious belief to justify inequality in
									the society. It considers the historical and current social reality of
									an individual and their group to decide the scaffolding required to
									provide a level playing field to them. It tries to remedy the sick
									society from its disease of casteism by implementing reservations.
								</p>

								<p>
									<strong>
										7. Is representation really an issue? What is reservation? Should
										reservation be implemented on the basis of economic
										criteria?
									</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									To understand if representation is really an issue, we can take a few
									examples. In 2018, in IIT Madras 255 out of 256 unreserved seats for
									which technically any caste or gender is eligible, went to upper
									castes. In 2017, women made up just 8% of the total student strength
									of all IITs put together. Results of a 2009 study found that when
									applying for a job, candidates with upper caste Hindu names were twice
									as likely to be called for interviews as compared to those with Dalit
									names, even if they had the same education and experience. So,
									caste-based discrimination is indeed an issue which needs redressal.
								</p>
								<p>
									We have many problems in society such as poverty, unemployment,
									overpopulation etc. All these problems have their own mechanisms and
									accordingly separate means to address them. Lack of representation due
									to caste discrimination is a distinct problem and has its own
									historical genesis and hence its own unique remedy. Reservation is a
									scheme of affirmative action to ensure representation of historically
									marginalized communities in employment, educational institutions and
									legislature. It is not a poverty alleviation program hence the
									criteria to address caste based lower representation can never be
									economic. It is very evident from daily news that economic mobility or
									higher education or even attainment of legislative positions (see 3.c)
									doesn’t allow any lower caste to surpass caste-based humiliation or
									torture. The purpose of reservation is to increase representation for
									historically oppressed communities - to put them in positions of power
									in boardrooms, newsrooms and courtrooms that they have been
									systematically kept out of for generations. If one understands caste
									as an actual source of power, and caste-discrimination as oppression
									instead of some vague disadvantage, one can understand why people need
									reservation on the basis of caste. The idea of reservation, the hope
									of reservation, is that once enough lower caste people are in
									positions of power, the effects of caste oppression can be countered.
									Reservations were never meant to single-handedly destroy the caste
									system, but they are a vital first step.

									<strong>
										8. Are the quality and efficiency put at stake when remedial
										measures taken to balance out Brahminical merit and achieve
										scientific constitutional merit?
									</strong>
								</p>
								<ol type="a">
									<li>
										<p><strong>Reservation in employment – </strong></p>
										<p>
											Prof. Ashwini Deshpande (Delhi School of Economics) and Prof.
											Thomas Weisskopf (University of Michigan) conducted a study on
											impact of reservation on productivity and efficiency in the Indian
											Railways between 1980 and 2002 and found that it did not reduce
											productivity in any sector, but had, in fact, raised it in some
											areas. The study also remarks that individuals from marginalised
											groups may be especially highly motivated to perform well when
											they attain decision-making and managerial positions, because of
											the fact that they have reached these positions in the face of
											claims that they are not sufficiently capable, and they may
											consequently have a strong desire to prove their detractors wrong.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p><strong>Reservation in educational institutions –</strong></p>
										<p>
											Reservation is only implemented at the entry level to facilitate
											entry of oppressed and systematically removed groups. All the
											students undergo the same training after the entry and have to
											pass similar standards set by respective courses in order to
											secure their degrees. So, there is no question of lack of
											capability or merit in a reserved category student, who just
											receives a push in the initial stage, and is allowed to pick up on
											his/her own once admitted.
										</p>
										<p>
											In October and November 2017, a study was carried out by Stanford
											University, AICTE and the World Bank on 45,453 first and
											third-year students across one IIT, seven NITs and other
											engineering institutes under the AICTE. It revealed that
											disadvantaged students (SC/ST/OBC) make significantly more gains
											than advantaged students in math, physics, and quantitative
											literacy from year one to year three.
